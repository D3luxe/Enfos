"Tips"
{
	"1"    "Easy difficulty was made for new players to learn the game, it's not competitive."
	"2"    "Picking a random hero grants you two Potions of Healing and 50% more gold each wave. But be careful, you may not always get what your team needs!"
	"3"    "Always try to pick a hero that complements the ones your teammates picked. It's very important to have a balanced team."
	"4"    "It's a good idea to set your SpellBringer to a control group (Ctrl key + a number) to reach it faster."
	"5"    "If you are going to pick random, try doing it first so that your allies can pick what is needed."
	"6"    "Everyone plays a role in your team. Try waiting for your allies to pick a hero then pick the one that you think would do best with them."
	"7"    "Always try to work with your teammates. Communication and teamplay are the keys to winning."
	"8"    "Rounded heroes can fulfill a variety of roles. Some work as secondary tanks, some as spell casters. They're very dynamic."
	"9"    "Players that pick support heroes are the perfect players to pool money to, since they're not often on the front. Give them your gold so that they'll bring items to you."
	"10"    "Each hero type has a specific role. You shouldn't play a support hero the same way you would play a caster."
	"11"    "Pooling money to one player to allows more powerful items earlier in the game."
	"12"    "Some heroes are not supposed to kill monsters, they have other roles on the team. That doesn't make them any useless. They just act different."
	"13"    "Anti-Magic Potions can save you from offensive spells in dangerous situations."
	"14"    "Some skills and items make you Magic Immune. Watch out! If you're trying to tank Magic Damage dealing creeps, they'll walk past you."
	"15"    "Different monsters have different abilities, the most common being stun, invisibility, and spell resistance. Try to remember which monster has which skill."
	"16"    "The Purification spell at your Spellbringer can dispel enemy summons."
	"17"    "Have any feedback or bug to report? Come to the workshop page and share your ideas with us!"
	"18"    "Most Support and Spellcaster heroes don't need items at all. They should get items that will help the tank to survive."
	"19"    "If you're a caster or support hero, try not to run out in front of your tank."
	"20"    "Remember that ranged heroes cannot gain lifesteal from equipment."
	"21"    "Cheaper items such as Gleaming Longsword are good in the early game, but rarely is it a good idea to get many of them."
	"22"    "The teleporters allow you to move around the map faster, please use them. They're located on the higher areas of the field."
	"23"    "Always remember to talk to your team and work together. Communication is one of the keys to winning."
	"24"    "Your Spellbringer is located between the lanes. It contains many powerful spells, try learning how to use each one."
	"25"    "Your summons are being dispelled? Try the Shear spell at the Spellbringer."
	"26"    "High level items can require wood, or require a combination of items to make them. Check the stores that are halfway up the map."
	"27"    "You can only have one copy of each Unique item, and only one Artifact at a time."
	"28"    "Combo items cannot be traded, sold, or moved. Choose carefully!"
	"29"    "Remember to not let your mana amount be higher than your life amount. A watchful enemy might Spell Disrupt you dead, instantly!"
	"30"    "Don't complain about offensive spells. It's part of the game, and without them the game would not be balanced."
	"31"    "If you kill an opponent but die while you were doing it, chances are that it was not worth it."
	"32"    "This game really doesn't have an end, the last wave keeps spawning until a team wins."
	"33"    "Don't get potions that don't suit your health (ex. a 1k potion with only 1.2k health). Remember that the higher the amount healed, higher is the potion's cooldown."
	"34"    "Don't play if you're going to quit once you die."
	"35"    "Use your spells in co-operation with your allies. A couple of chained spells might kill any opponent hero."
	"36"    "Some spells progress diferently as you put points. Some just keep working the same way but dealing more damage, while others get way better. Experiment all your skills, and don't judge one for it's first level."
	"37"    "Don't summon Sidhlot from your Spellbringer on your side. It will only work to revive allied units."
	"38"    "You can use your Spellbringer to defend or attack, but remember that most spells can be countered by your opponents."
	"39"    "Watch the enemy team for opportunities to kill them. The game is usually not won by simply outlasting the other team."
	"40"    "Some Spellbringer spells work best when used in combination with each other."
	"41"    "Getting stun-killed a lot? Remember that you can dodge stun missiles by teleporting as soon as you hear the lightning sound effect. If that didn't work, the Spellbringer's Chain Heal is a nice counter as well."
	"42"    "The game is balanced on the normal difficulty. Chances are that all the other difficulties will break game balance somehow."
